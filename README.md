# 🦾 Harmony InMoov Project

### 🌟 Collaborative AI-Powered Robotics Project at Harmony School of Advancement, Houston

Welcome to the **Harmony InMoov Project**, where we bring robotics to life! This project, developed by **Harmony School of Advancement students** in collaboration with, **Mikial Alici**, and **Victor Valadez**, integrates **AI, speech recognition, and servo motor control** to create a dynamic, interactive InMoov robot.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for controlling an **InMoov robot's speech-driven movements**, including:

- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition** – Processes human speech using Python.
- 🤖 **AI Interaction** – Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate responses.
- 🎭 **Servo-Controlled Expressions** – Mouth and eye movements synchronized with speech.

With **Python handling AI and speech recognition**, and **Arduino controlling servos**, this project aims to blend **automation, conversational AI, and robotics** into an immersive experience.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 🔹 **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **Python 3.9.10** 📌
- **Arduino IDE** 📌
- **Git** 📌 (for version control)
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install openai pyttsx3 speechrecognition python-dotenv
  ```

Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository 📂

git clone https://github.com/victorvaladez1/HSAInMoovProject
cd HSAInMoovProject

Set Up OpenAI API Key 🔐
Create a file in the project directory.
Add your API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

Upload Arduino Code
Open Arduino IDE.
Upload to your Arduino board.

⃣ Run the Python Script
python Talking.py

💡 Your robot should now listen, respond, and move dynamically

⚙️ How It Works
This project is powered by a combination of Python, Arduino, and AI models: 1️⃣ Speech Recognition

🔧 Troubleshooting
🚫 Common Issues & Fixes
✅ Git not recognized?

✅ API Key Error (401)?

✅ Speech recognition not working?
